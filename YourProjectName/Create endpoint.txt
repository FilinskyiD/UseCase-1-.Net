Allowed to use only: .NET 6 SDK, C#10, ASP.NET Core WebAPI/Minimal API, Extrenal public "REST Countries" API. 
Create the endpoint that accepts parameters.
Endpoint could accept from 0 to 4 parameters, type string, number, string. Naming is optional. (Swagger is enough here) 
Make a request to the public `REST Countries` API using endpoint https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all 
Parse retrieved API response data in JSON to variable/object. 


Certainly! To accomplish the task you've outlined, you'll need to create a new ASP.NET Core WebAPI project and then follow the steps below:

Install the necessary packages like System.Net.Http.Json for making HTTP requests and deserializing JSON data.

Create the model classes based on the structure of the REST Countries API response.

Create a controller with an endpoint that accepts up to 4 parameters.

Use an HttpClient to fetch data from the REST Countries API, and then parse the JSON response into a variable/object.

Here is a simplified example:

csharp
Copy code
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

// Define a class to represent a country.
public class Country
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Alpha2Code { get; set; }
    public string Alpha3Code { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<string> Borders { get; set; }
}

[ApiController]
public class CountryController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public CountryController()
    {
        _httpClient = new HttpClient();
    }

    [HttpGet("api/countries")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetCountries(
        [FromQuery] string str1 = null, 
        [FromQuery] int num1 = 0, 
        [FromQuery] string str2 = null, 
        [FromQuery] int num2 = 0)
    {
        // Make the HTTP request to the REST Countries API
        var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all");
        if (!response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {
            return BadRequest("Could not retrieve countries");
        }

        // Parse the JSON response
        var countries = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<List<Country>>();

        // Here, you can use str1, num1, str2, num2 to filter or manipulate the countries list
        // ...

        return Ok(countries);
    }
}
Note: Before running the project, make sure you've added the necessary using directive for JSON extension methods for HttpClient, which should be added automatically if you're using .NET 6 SDK.

Finally, for Swagger support, make sure to update the Configure method in Startup.cs or Program.cs to include the Swagger middleware. You can do this using the following:

app.UseSwagger();
app.UseSwaggerUI(c => c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "My API V1"));

This example should be a good starting point for your requirements. Note that I haven't done any detailed error handling or logging, both of which you would likely want to include in a more complete implementation.



Convert to Minimal API

Certainly! You can achieve the same functionality using the Minimal API features available in .NET 6. Here is an example:

Firstly, add the NuGet package for System.Net.Http.Json if you haven't already, so you can easily make HTTP requests and work with JSON.

Now, update your Program.cs:
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Net.Http.Json;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseSwagger();
    app.UseSwaggerUI(c => c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "My API V1"));
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();

app.MapGet("/api/countries", async (string? str1, int? num1, string? str2, int? num2) =>
{
    using var httpClient = new HttpClient();
    var response = await httpClient.GetAsync("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all");
    
    if (!response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        return Results.BadRequest("Could not retrieve countries");
    }

    var countries = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<List<Country>>();
    
    // Here, you can use str1, num1, str2, num2 to filter or manipulate the countries list
    // ...

    return Results.Ok(countries);
}).Produces<List<Country>>(); // Adding type information for Swagger

public class Country
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Alpha2Code { get; set; }
    public string Alpha3Code { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<string> Borders { get; set; }
}

app.Run();

This version of the program uses a Minimal API approach, where you define routes as lambda functions right in the Program.cs file. I've used the MapGet method to specify that this is a GET endpoint and that it takes up to four parameters.

For Swagger, you can still use the same middleware as before. Make sure to include the necessary NuGet package for Swagger.

Remember that I didn't add much error handling or logging, which you would likely want to include in a production application.
